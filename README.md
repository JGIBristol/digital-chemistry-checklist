# Chemspeed Helper: 
**🚧Under construction 🚧**

## Intro
This repository is a resource for research groups using a [Chemspeed](https://www.chemspeed.com/) machine to perform automated experiments. We provide documentation and templates to help groups create a workflow that ensures their Chemspeed data stays safe, properly labelled, and reusable, even when users join and leave the group. 

We hope that this will:
1. Make things easier for researchers, by helping them to keep their data lablled . 
2. Facilitate the collection of larger datasets, which will allow for the application of machine learning and other techniques.

## Our software

## Our documentation and templates


We have written the following documentation:
[documents/our-approach.md](): Gives an overview of our approach.
[documents/it-setup.md](): Explains how to set up a computer attached to a Chemspeed machine in order to facilitate our approach. Useful to share with your IT department. 
[documents/templates/technician-template.md](): Template guidelines, for a technician working with users of a Chemspeed machine.
[documents/templates/user-template.md](): Template guidelines, for regular users of a Chemspeed machine.

Documentation and templates are written in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown), which an is easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format. You can convert the markdown files to your favourite format (e.g. html, latex, PDF, word, etc), for example using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)).
