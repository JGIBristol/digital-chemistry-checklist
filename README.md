## Intro
This repository is a resource for research groups using a automated chemical synthesis machine to perform automated experiments. We provide documentation, checklists, and templates to help groups create a workflow that ensures their data stays safe, properly labelled, and reusable, even when users join and leave the group. 

We hope that this will:
1. Make things easier for researchers, by helping them to keep their data labelled, backed up, and organised. 
2. Facilitate the collection of larger datasets, which will allow for the application of machine learning and other techniques.

<!-- 
## Our software
In the future we could have software to automate part of the work. 

## Our documentation and templates
<!--
We have written the following documentation:
* [documents/our-approach.md](documents/our-approach.md): Gives an overview of our approach.
* [documents/it-setup.md](documents/it-setup.md): Explains how to set up a computer attached to a Chemspeed machine in order to facilitate our approach. Useful to share with your IT department. 
* [documents/templates/technician-template.md](documents/templates/technician-template.md): Template guidelines, for a technician working with users of a Chemspeed machine.
* [documents/templates/user-template.md](documents/templates/user-template.md): Template guidelines, for regular users of a Chemspeed machine.
-->

Documentation and templates are written in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown), which an is easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format. You can convert the markdown files to your favourite format (e.g. html, latex, PDF, word, etc), for example using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)).
