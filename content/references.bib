  abstract  = "There is an intuitive analogy of an organic chemist's
               understanding of a compound and a language speaker's
               understanding of a word. Based on this analogy, it is possible
               to introduce the basic concepts and analyze potential impacts of
               linguistic analysis to the world of organic chemistry. In this
               work, we cast the reaction prediction task as a translation
               problem by introducing a template-free sequence-to-sequence
               model, trained end-to-end and fully data-driven. We propose a
               tokenization, which is arbitrarily extensible with reaction
               information. Using an attention-based model borrowed from human
               language translation, we improve the state-of-the-art solutions
               in reaction prediction on the top-1 accuracy by achieving 80.3\%
               without relying on auxiliary knowledge, such as reaction
               templates or explicit atomic features. Also, a top-1 accuracy of
               65.4\% is reached on a larger and noisier dataset.",

              catalysts have functions that are defined by mixtures of
              molecular and mesoscale components. As yet, this
              multi-length-scale complexity cannot be fully captured by
              atomistic simulations, and the design of such materials from
              first principles is still rare1-5. Likewise, experimental
              complexity scales exponentially with the number of variables,
              restricting most searches to narrow areas of materials space.
              Robots can assist in experimental searches6-14 but their
              widespread adoption in materials research is challenging because
              of the diversity of sample types, operations, instruments and
              measurements required. Here we use a mobile robot to search for
              improved photocatalysts for hydrogen production from water15. The
              robot operated autonomously over eight days, performing 688
              experiments within a ten-variable experimental space, driven by a
              batched Bayesian search algorithm16-18. This autonomous search
              identified photocatalyst mixtures that were six times more active
              than the initial formulations, selecting beneficial components
              and deselecting negative ones. Our strategy uses a dexterous19,20
              free-roaming robot21-24, automating the researcher rather than
              the instruments. This modular approach could be deployed in

              photocatalysis.",

  title     = "Learning When Training Data are Costly: The Effect of Class
               Distribution on Tree Induction",
  author    = "Weiss, G M and Provost, F",
  abstract  = "For large, real-world inductive learning problems, the number of
               training examples often must be limited due to the costs
               associated with procuring, preparing, and storing the training
               examples and/or the computational costs associated with learning
               from them. In such circumstances, one question of practical
               importance is: if only n training examples can be selected, in
               what proportion should the classes be represented? In this
               article we help to answer this question by analyzing, for a
               fixed training-set size, the relationship between the class
               distribution of the training data and the performance of
               classification trees induced from these data. We study
               twenty-six data sets and, for each, determine the best class
               distribution for learning. The naturally occurring class
               distribution is shown to generally perform well when classifier
               performance is evaluated using undifferentiated error rate (0/1
               loss). However, when the area under the ROC curve is used to
               evaluate classifier performance, a balanced distribution is
               shown to perform well. Since neither of these choices for class
               distribution always generates the best-performing classifier, we
               introduce a budget-sensitive progressive sampling algorithm for
               selecting training examples based on the class associated with
               each example. An empirical analysis of this algorithm shows that
               the class distribution of the resulting training set yields
               classifiers with good (nearly-optimal) classification
               performance.",
